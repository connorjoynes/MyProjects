This Project was to develop a Monte Carlo Simulation and Use Random walks to simulate the spread of Covid-19 in an inside environment.

In this repositry is:
-My Python code for the Simulation
-My written report for the Monte Carlo Project including statistical analysis
-Plots produced from the simulation
